delete:
    //go to 5. to test result
    const playerSelection = "rock";
    const computerSelection = getComputerChoice(arr);
    console.log(playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection));

When open window, it doesn't ask user to input rock, paper, or scissors

Advice from discord:

//
"So, I've finished. Let's view what is wrong step by step: 
1) arr has to be declared before getComputerChoice function
2) playerSelection has to be declared before playRound function
3) to call a function you should write its name with parentheses(with arguments inside if needed). 
4) in function game() you tried to call playRound() function before the loop, but it's wrong because you want to call this function inside the loop
5) also you need to move prompt inside of the loop because you want to ask the user's choice each round 
6) you declared 'result' variable but never used it 
7) you tried to handle case-sensitive inputs but overthink yourself. Instead, just use toLowerCase method for user input because you already use lowercase strings for the computer choice
8) function parameters are unnecessary in your code because you use global variables 
9) I think using 'else if' is not good for readability. Only 'if' is enough


This is how I fixed it (suggest you fix code by yourself first): https://codepen.io/Praesidi/pen/zYJqYVb?editors=0010 "
